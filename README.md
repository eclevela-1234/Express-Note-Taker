**This project showcases basic node.js server functionality using the express.js library and deployment using heroku. The user is directed to a landing page where they can then select the [Get Started] button to visit the application. The application allows the user to enter, retrieve and delete notes using api routes. Nothing fancy here, just good working code. A bigger app would warrant code modularization and router functionality. Getting the routes to work and thinking through the save and delete functions was rewarding once I figured it out.**
